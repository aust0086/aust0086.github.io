            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Alysha Austin. My birthday is October 10<sup>th</sup>, 2004, which means I will be 20 soon. I
                am
                a first-semester student in the interactive media program at Algonquin College. I am from a town called
                Alliston which is about <em>5 hours</em> away by car, so I currently live in residence on campus.
                Something I'm hoping to get out
                of this program is a better understanding of everything taught in the program. I have a basic knowledge
                of
                <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and I enjoyed learning about it but I did not want
                to go into a program where it was just web development, I knew I liked photography and video so that's
                why
                I chose this program.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time, I like to learn about Greek mythology. I'm currently reading The Odyssey by Homer.
                Reading
                is also a hobby of mine. It's not always about Greek mythology, but mostly. I also like music, I like
                that music is subjective and that everyone has different perspectives of songs and music, based on their
                life
                experiences.

        <h4>Here is a quote I like</h4>
        <blockquote>Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell
            us
            that dragons can be beaten.-<cite>Neil Gaiman
